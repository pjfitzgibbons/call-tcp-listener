The data feed is organized as a stream of records.
While the receiving application can organize the data as it wishes, the data targets the below schema.

	CREATE TABLE call_activity (
	source               varchar(64)   NOT NULL,
	timestamp            datetime      NOT NULL,
	dnis                 varchar(32)   NOT NULL,
	direction            integer       NOT NULL,
	num_active           integer       NOT NULL,
	num_complete         integer       NOT NULL,
	total_time           integer       NOT NULL,
	UNIQUE(source, timestamp, dnis),
	PRIMARY KEY(source, timestamp, dnis)
	);

Every N seconds, a load report is generated by the call processor having call_activity records. 
Every record has a prefix that indicates
its type ('call_activity'), followed by the host from which the report originated ('source') and 
the timestamp (epoch seconds) at which the record was constructed.

call_activity
=============
This record has the format:

	call_activity|%s|%ld|%s|%d|%d|%d|%d}
	
The format specifiers correspond to :

	hostname, timestamp, DNIS, direction of call, no of active calls for that dnis,
	no of completed calls to the DNIS that ended in the interval T --> T+N, 
	total duration of all calls to DNIS that ended in the interval T --> T+N.

	direction codes =>  0:internal,1:inbound,2:outbound
